# Photon Detection

This is the folder for my final project 

For this task, my advisor assigned three individual steps to help me 
become more accustomed to the programming language, and how to work with the [ZedBoard](https://www.avnet.com/wps/portal/us/products/avnet-boards/avnet-board-families/zedboard/). I have currently completed the first two steps and I am still working to finish the last one. 

## STEP 1: Create a counter in Vivado utilizing VHDL and see the results in Simulink
- This folder contains one vhd file, one constraints file and one testbench

Expected Simulinnk Output:

## STEP 2: Use the counter established in Step 1, and toggle one of the LED outputs at a consistent frequency
- This folder contains one vhd files and one constraints file

Expected Board Output:
